This documents aims to explain how to create your own templates.

For now it just started and is not yet finished!!!



For starters:
Just take the default-template in <phorum-dir>/templates/default and copy it over
to another name, i.e. <phorum-dir>/templates/mytemplate .
Then edit <phorum-dir>/templates/mytemplate/info.php and change at least $name i.e. to
$name="My very own template";

Thats it, you can now select the new template in the admin as general template and/or 
for each single forum.

Additional variables in info.php:
$template_hide=1;
set this to hide this template from the user's template-selection box. 
Now only you can set this template through the admin.
(makes most sense if you set the display-settings to fixed through the admin)

Additional variables in settings.tpl:
{define bodies_in_list 1}
set this to 1 to have the message-bodies loaded in the list if your template needs them.
