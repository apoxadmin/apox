Preliminary Upgrade-Instructions


Please keep in mind, that these instructions are neither
complete nor final.

1.) Upgrading from a phorum5-version to another phorum5-version

The simplest upgrade method is just to download a newer phorum5 package, and extract it on top of the current one.
Then edit include/db/config.php with your database settings, and go to your Phorum. If a database upgrade is
needed, you will be prompted to go to the admin page.

This preserves all of your settings and modules, but will overwrite hacks and any changes made to the default
template (templates/default, other templates will be alright). To preserve these changes, you should either extract 
the new phorum to its own directory and reapply your changes, or back up your existing installation so you can 
reapply the changes to the new one while it is "live".


2.) Upgrading from phorum-3.4.x to phorum5

There is a small script in the scripts dir, named phorum3to5convert.php.
It contains instructions at the top of itself.
This script is also not yet complete, it converts forums, messages, users, groups
and moderators. 
NOT yet converted are attachments ... permission-LEVELS will never be converted.

Also there is an additional script named "update_postcount.php" in the scripts-directory.
It updates the number of posts of a user which is shown in their profile.
If you want correct numbers just run this once AFTER the conversion is done.
It needs to be copied over to the main phorum5-directory too before its run.
