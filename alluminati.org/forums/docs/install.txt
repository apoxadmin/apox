Phorum 5 Basic Instalation
--------------------------------------------

Believe it or not, it is this simple:

1. Create a database and a user for that database. See your database
   docs for how to do this.  We can't explain them all here.

2. Edit include/db/config.php.sample, save it as include/db/config.php
   (drop the '.sample')

3. Go to {forum url}/admin.php.

4. Follow directions.

5. Edit Settings - You must save this Settings page before moving on
   or Phorum will not work.  Mainly, you will need to enter the email
   information at the very bottom.  The other settings are defaulted
   or not required.  You may however want to look over them carefully.

6. Test

7. Read faq.txt, and any other files in the docs dir that may help you.


Optional change on *nix
------------------------
Linux, BSD, Solaris, etc.

In step 5 above (Edit Settings) There is an entry called Cache Directory.
the installer should set that to /tmp if you appear to be running a *nix
system.  This will keep compiled PHP versions of your templates in /tmp.
You can change the cache dir if you do not want to have your files sitting
in /tmp on the server or if you see error messages like:

Warning:
fopen(/tmp/tpl-default-header-a72fb9dd20915e5953aa9b07d3eb3871.php):
failed to open stream: Permission denied in
/path/to/phorum/include/templates.php on line 184

If you change the the Cache Directory, the best bet is to set it
to ./cache and make that dir (that is already there in the Phorum dir)
writable by the web server.  Most likely this means making it world
writeable (chmod 777).  If you do not have access to the shell prompt
of the server and are using only FTP to access the server, please see
your FTP clients help on setting the permissions for a dir.



Additional issues for Windows
------------------------------

In step 5 above (Edit Settings) There is an entry called Cache Directory.
the installer should set that to C:\Windows\Temp. if it can detect you are
using Windows.  This should work for most modern Windows versions.  If it
does not, you will see error messages like:

Warning:
fopen(c:\windows\temp\tpl-default-header-a72fb9dd20915e5953aa9b07d3eb3871.php):
failed to open stream: Permission denied in
c:\path\to\phorum\include\templates.php on line 184

You will need to change the Cache Directory.  The Phorum team is not very
familiar with Windows as a web server platform.  We can only tell you that it
will need to be something that the web server can write to.  ./cache has
worked for some.

Also, windows does not support strftime fully.  You will need to edit your
language file and change the lines: 

    $PHORUM['long_date']="%B %e, %Y %I:%M%p";
    $PHORUM['short_date']="%D %I:%M%p";

to something that will work for you.  You can see 
http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for information on the
formatting options as well as the formats that Windows does not support.
