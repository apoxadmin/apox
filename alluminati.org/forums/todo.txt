5.1.x todos (in no order):
---------------------------
more speed through caching

default forum options in admin

inheritence of forum settings.

link from list page to the first new message of a thread.
--Put a link on the followed thread page to the last post in the thread.

completely new template from scratch
--feature more of the data that forum has
--use more advanced CSS

redo mysql search to use fulltext/like mix

check for forum being down and give the admin the option to down the forum.

make announcements have a better reason that you can not reply to them.

super-stickies - stickies on all forums

Reply (post-form) in separate page (optional)

more moderation functions: 
--thread-split/thread-merge
--move a message to be its own thread

virtual root-folders
no more folders-forums have sub forums

preview when editing message

reply to a message via pm

"mark thread read" in read-view

support for more db-layers (goal we will need help with)

other todo that might get done:
--------------------------------
figure out how to not require caching of templates

moderator access to forum properties

configure the order in which modules run in a hook.

allow users to provide urls in place of uploads.


todos that could be modules or core parts
------------------------------------------
adding options to block users/ips/names/emails from read-view (some icons behind the username?)

optional image security code for posting to prevent scripted posts (um, mod?)


todos that have been replaced with modules
-------------------------------------------
show attachments inline
