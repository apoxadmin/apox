Mingle Forum allows you to easily and quickly put a Forum on your Wordpress site/blog.

== Description ==
Have you been looking for a Forum Plugin for WordPress that *just works*? Then look no further! Mingle Forum has been modified to be lightweight, solid, secure, quick to setup, easy to use, and best of all it now integrates seamlessly with or without the Mingle social networking plugin (by Blair Williams). The mission of Mingle Forum is, to **KEEP IT SIMPLE** There are a handful of Forum Plugins for WordPress available but they are either super buggy, difficult to install, or so bloated with features and settings that its a nightmare setting them up. Dont do that to yourself!!! You can be up and running with Mingle Forum fully installed and configured in as little as 5 minutes -- pretty cool eh?

= Notes =
* Mingle forum 1.0.32 uses a new email subscription system. All old subscriptions will be lost after upgrading. This will allow much better email support for the future.
* If you use Wordpress 2.9.2 or older you will need to download Mingle Forum vs. 1.0.27 as of 1.0.28+ only Wordpress 3.0+ is supported
* As of Mingle Forum Vs 1.0.03 the skins directory has been changed to /wp-content/mingle-forum-skins/ [Tell Me More...](http://cartpauj.icomnow.com/forum/?mingleforumaction=viewtopic&t=64.0)
* If youre switching from WP Forum or Forum Server you will lose your skin and settings but you will NOT lose your categories, forums, groups, or topics which makes it very easy to make the transition :)
