  <h3>F.A.Q</h3>
  <p>Q: How to insert your image slider into a header or index file of my Twentyeleven theme?</p>
  <p>To do that simply insert the following PHP code into your theme's header.php or index.php file, wherever you need it:</p>
  <pre>
	if (function_exists('get_thethe_image_slider')) {
		print get_thethe_image_slider('Slider Name');
	}
</pre>
  <p> And do not forget to replace that "SliderName" placeholder with your real slider name. </p>
