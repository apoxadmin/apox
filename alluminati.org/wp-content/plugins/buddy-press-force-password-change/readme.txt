Force Buddypress users to change their password on their next login.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a checkbox option to the "edit user" screen in the WordPress admin that, when checked, will force a user to change their password the next time they log into their account. The end user's "change of password" experience is very simple and clean. When they log in they will be immediately presented with a modal dialog that prompts them for a new password and MUST successfully change their password prior to continuing to use the site.

== Installation ==
