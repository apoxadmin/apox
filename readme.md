# Alpha Phi Omega-Chi Chapter Website
## Wordpress Edition
Hello friendos! It's been a while since we've last updated this but here we go!
## Who?
This repository is run by the Admin VPs for the APO X chapter. This repository is meant to be viewed by anyone in the fraternity, for both members of the Admin committees to curious members.
### What?
This is the website as of June 9th, 2018. It's hosted on WordPress, with edits to the Coraline theme to code things so it's not just a blog page.
## Why?
We want to continue updating the website, especially before it breaks (RIP Alpha Tau events, lost to the WordPress update). This repository is to make sure we don't heck up the website by accident without a backup. In the future, we want to expand our purpose to helping facilitate collaboration as more people can work on the site together (and world peace and happiness on earth is achieved).
## When?
Here's a quick timeline of stuff we're planning on doing for the site!
9/24: Quarter Begins
9/17: Old Site Finished
9/10: Profile Pictures Fixed
9/3: Redesign Rush
8/27: Add Pictures to Contact Us

## How?
Here's the fun part. We're going to be working on both front end and back end of the site, trying to improve the functionality of the site for both members and visitors. Front end changes will be mainly through WordPress, although the fact that some of the functions are coded directly into the Coraline theme makes it possibly too difficult to switch themes. As a result, some of the front end will be coded directly through the php files stored in ./wp-content/themes/custom instead. Back end changes will mainly be through the same files, although they will be limited as we shift our focus on designing the new website!
## Want to contribute?
Yes *please*! All the help will be gladly appreciated! Contact the Admin VP's and we'll work with you to get this site to be the next Google -- no coding experience needed :)
