Upgrading is available on dev channel from both last dev release (5.3.2) and last stable release (5.2.3):

it and report us feedbacks about migration process.

[Summary]

New orbit theme stabilisation - JS perfs optimizations
Object backends drivers upgrades :
- S3: Use more recent AWS SDK version for S3, make the plugin more flexible to easily speak with S3-compatible storages. Tested on Ceph storage.
- Swift: Replaced deprecated access.hpcloud by access.swift using openstack-sdk-php library
Extended new GraphViewer editor for logs analytics dashboard
Stabilisation of the new sharing engine
Uploaders: user can choose a different uploader on the fly
Diaporama: show low-res photo version
CAS Authentication: full rewrite, including ability to handle a ProxyTicket for further mounting operation
Added PostgreSQL & Sqlite support for new indexation features (req. by sync)
Security:
- Transformed auth.otp into an authfront, thus working with any auth backend.
- New plugin auth.duosecurity.
- New plugin for validating a disclaimer before using the platform [still exp.]
- Strengthen meta.mount security - by Christian Biamont & Patrik Lundin
New translations (italian, russian, german) by DepaMarco, Matsimon and Mtskar

[Upgrade Process]

- Archive installations (zip/tar.gz)
First switch the "Update Engine" channel (in the plugin options) to the "Development" channel.
From 5.3.2 (dev) : automatic with in-app upgrade, only files are impacted.
From 5.2.3 (stable) : automatic with in-app upgrade. HOWEVER, make sure to backup both your DB and your files.

- Linux packages (deb/rpm)
Package is available in the testing channel for both repositories.
Database migration is not performed automatically, please use this script to manually upgrade your DB.
REMARK ABOUT SHARING: Old share links will be still active, but user will have to migrate them manually. As the new ones allow to manually set the final hash of the link, users will have to stop public links, recreate them, and change the hash.

[Known Issues]

The new theme is not yet fully optimized for mobile devices, and not at all supported by IE8 and earlier
User dashboard sometimes need some manual resizing to have all panel appear.
>> See github repository to see the list of existing issues and help us resolve them!
Rewrite rules in Htaccess files are to be "translated" for other webservers (nginx, IIS). Again, contribs welcome!

Pydio 5.3.1 Release Note

This is a development release, it should not be used in production.
This release is necessary to test the desktop sync client

License: Affero GPL
Copyright: Charles du Jeu 2014
Demo: https://demo.pyd.io/
Date: June, 20th 2014

. Keep an up-to-date index and trigger a change feed via SQL triggers : used by the sync client
. Split auth plugins into auth backends and auth frontends. Latter can be tested one by one until a credential is detected.
. Create a "Keystore" based auth frontend for simplify REST api login
. Enable routing between workspace via URL (backbone-based)
. API enhancements
. Massive refactoring of shares to store them in DB instead of data/public/ folder.
. Massive refactoring for scalability when tons of users and tons of workspace
. Italian translation

Add image rotation using exif information
Added auth plugin for radius.
Add a small Backbone extension to enable URL routing
Add a node.index hook and use it in the meta.syncable. We should probably split index.lucene into a core component browsing recursively and the implementation using lucene.
Make sure the slug is applied at workspace creation even if from a template.
Make sure mkfile is compatible with the node signature
Higher filtering level for filename
Rewrite pattern update 'starts with'
Fix tabs re-opening / Fix 'circular JSON structure' error by filtering data before saving.
Do not remove all whitespaces, too restrictive
Activate rest for stat_hash action
Pass application Root for history manager. We should have an htaccess generation at install, as it's getting more complicated to configure.
Update htaccess comment
Create a template for htaccess, should be generated at install time
Add methods for recursive search of metadata and implement this by hooking into ShareCenter to make sure shared workspaces are synchronized to their parent and the other way. Added some performance optimizations on the way, to be extensively tested, could have some side-effects. Remove some debugging in AJXP_Cache
AJXP_Node: collect many metadata namespace at once Implement recursion in meta.watch > to be tested extensively
Make sure parent node is detected as non-leaf in notif fix #449 and fix #451 in dev branch
Add an option to fix #195 : force all emails to be sent by a unique adress
Detect Backbone before starting the router Attach mobile scroll in AjxpSimpleTabs Fix #373 Date modified sorting wrong Fix some small umbra/oxygen tweaks, especially the fact that if you turn this inadvertently you cannot go back...
Fix icon for folders in notification feed Fix some ie8 error, dashboard is still unusable.
Resplit LOG field into source, message and params - Close #483 Upgrade to be tested on PostgreSQL
Fix PowerFS charset problems
Should fix some errors with nodes parameter array when sending to background
Sanitize and decode archive name (see #480)
Add a parameter for optionally loading some JS frameworks before anything else. Leave it empty by default for the moment, to avoid letting people load backbone without knowledge.
Previous FilesList commit broke the scrolling
Revert the $plugin instance cloning, broke the REST api. Instead, make sure to reload node driver on original node after applying forward event.
Meta.exif : ignore UndefinedTag: key
WS selector: visually show that element was selected
Handle a path filter on the changes feed to synchronize only a subfolder
Add the missing German translation
Make sure to update $lastSeq if we "continue" the loop
Make sure the like $filter expression ends up with a slash, otherwise it can take files beginning with the same prefix.
Handle a path filter on the changes feed to synchronize only a subfolder (cherry picked from commit e3b580c)
Make sure to update $lastSeq if we "continue" the loop (cherry picked from commit 0ea7b2d)
Make sure the like $filter expression ends up with a slash, otherwise it can take files beginning with the same prefix. (cherry picked from commit 5f8f7a0)
Update CLA link
smb.php with Windows OS
Update README.md
Remove scrutinizer badge it's too depressing.
Create configure_php_modules.sh
Zoho Editor is broken when not using the "External Agent"
Fix key max length is 1000 bytes for mysql, plus fields length consistency
smb.php don't work with lot of files or folders if "Windows OS"
Quick integration of the analytics SQL queries. Warning, they are working on the old tables formats, to be updated.
Keep the right order
Add titles
Change cursor system / create empty values when there is no value on a given date.
Make queries compatible with both tables format (before and after update) by simply searching on message or params.
Fix hasGroupMapping test using empty() function, can lead to a false positive if an empty string.
Make sure to encode labels as UTF-8.
Bar plots and Figures.
Add some figures
Bring some life to analytics dashboard
Fix color index modulo compute
Fix HTML5 folder uploads issues, enable it for Mac
Fix SQL analytics date cursor (include last day)
Let the ajxp_user ( = dashboard ) repository always "accessible".
Update comment
Make sure to clone the original personal role before overriding. Re-apply specific "Shared" roles after clearing parent user's ACLs in case of a shared user.
Re-revert the isMac test for webkitGetAsEntry, otherwise utf8 files are skipped on MacOS.
Fix #496 : clear metadata when a shared link is expired (by date or number of downloads)
core.mailer: Make sure to add a typed email to the list of "to", if people don't explicitely click on the auto-complete list.
Admin : restrict Parameters & Actions edition when logged user is a groupAdmin (not super admin). Only parameters with a scope are allowed.
Disable old "Shared Elements" workspace by default (will be removed at one point)
Fix #418 : duplicate functions loadPublicletData & clearExpiredFiles, all moved to ShareCenter Fix events applied to various nodes : we must reset the AJXP_Controller xPath to make sure the hooks are cleaned up as well. Should be reimplemented in an event-based pattern.
Ajxp_user : reload shared files list after clearing expired / Fix list object ID
Update AJXP_Logger::debug() calls
[edito.pixlr] Fix #500, properly close editor tab after saving
Update default repositories with last features
Fix rest URI computation
Todo: implement indexNode method
Test hidden files during the filterFile() call when building Zips - Fix #532
Use SystemTextEncoding::magicDequote insteaod of decodeSecureMagic when handling json data, it MUST be utf-8 for json_decode function - Fix #529
Manually merge #300 : exif rotation
Manual merge of #300 exif rotation
Editor.diaporama : exif rotation changes broke ImageViewer (extending Diaporama)
Massive refactoring: generalize usage of UserSelection object instead of always parsing the $httpVars["file"] variable. Prepend base64 encoded versions for auto-detection, should be backward-compatible.
Add new carrousel-like display mode for file list : horizontalScroll and fit:content
Folder "Recycle_bin" must be Hidden with attribute "H" if Windows OS
GUI : AjxpTabulator: new option uniqueTab will always replace existing editor in tab. FilesList: call fit:content inside resizeThumbnails() function Last compile
Ability to define many templates for the minisites (name must begin with minisite_) and user can choose. Sample template is Film Strip, super simple.
Replace "Download All" icon with archive otherwise when no text Download and Download All conflict.
Fix share height
WebODF: Use ajxpServerAccessPath instead hardcoding index.php
- see result here #510 - rebuilt with branch "develop"
Attach ContentFilter to a repository - Save it as serialized option for conf.sql
Implement same filterings when listing only one or N specific nodes, instead of browsing a folder. Make shell_exec call silent on windows.
WIP: modularization of sharing features. Put the templates back in action.share instead of gui.ajax - Split the share action into many actions the will appear in the menu depending on the selection. Remove old clientForm, TODO make sure everything is working on "Umbra".
Notification list: back from 600 to 350 ;-) @ellega
Forgotten print_r in PThumb.lib.php
Fix film strip on mobile device => fix various diaporama stuff
Reproduce the "background image" of the current public link page directly as an AjxpPane option. WIP : make a "download page" template to replace public_links php file.
Don't preg_quote() and later stripslashes(), move preg_quote in the right places
Use self:: instead of AuthService:: in AuthService
Replace eval with constant in getConfInst
Move regexpToLike to AJXP_Utils
Introduce cleanRegexp()
New option in Auth to preset a login, providing a password-only protection for minisites
Reput the main templates in gui.ajax instead of action.share, otherwise they can be not found.
Make all calls to ShareCenter no more static, and split this class into a new ShareStore class, that will implement a DB-based storage (and maintain backward compat to publiclets). Add a download preProcessor to count the downloads.
Introduce likeToLike and cleanLike in AJXP_Utils
getUsersCount auth.sql: use dibi ... again
Stop restraining search by putting ^
Download page
Minisites & publiclinks convergence, use simpleStoreGet/Set/List methods to store shares in the DB.
Fix pending login mechanism. Still somethig todo with various sessions opened.
fix Jumploader
fix ldap build group branch
json_encode object-like options when sending repository options.
Never store share meta on root node.
Massive rework of the shares storage & metadata => ability to build many links/workspace on each node, ability to move nodes without breaking (at least nodes directly shared, should be expanded to the children...), event forwarding to shared workspaces. To be tested extensively, particularly migration from old metadata format to new one. To be tested : URL shorteners.
One session per window in minisite makes it more convenient. Could be generalized to standard window.
Check if node exists when send unique file.
Do not use func()[0] for old php versions
AjxpPane image background: get defaultImage from parameter
ShareCenter: always write the RewriteRules in the htaccess. Set default images for download link.
ActionsManager / ActionsToolbar refactoring to handle a "local" datamodel. To be even more simplified if possible. Use it in RepositoryEditor to display a tab with all shares of the current edited workspace.
Change depandancy of action.cart
Conf/Auth driver : use a "ajxp.hidden" property to generally ignore all internal users created by minisites. Add powerfull methods to query repositories (directly in sql when possible).
Encapsulate new listRepositoriesWithCriteria() methods in ConfService. Use in ajxp_conf
Use new methods in action.share and access.ajxp_conf In ShareStore methods, pass userId instead of object.
Silently ignore wrong results in lucene.
Make sure the user object is not null - see previous commits.
Do not authorize ajxp_user repo by default ( = dashboard ) Disable "switch_to_dashboard_action" if repo is not allowed.
Update TPL access. Should be written at install time, along with the default charset.
Base for repository-specific authentication via a prompt dialog. Test in FTP by uncommenting the line. Could be used for the dropbox stuff.
Use html fullScreen
Fix RESTfull mkfile - too harsh sanitization clears the slashes in path
Fix minisite session detection (starts with AjaXplorer_Shared, not necessarily exactly that word)
Bug: dblclick was triggered twice on non-ie browsers
AbstractEditor last change: use className instead of class.
Update docblocks
Definitely set skipBubbling and skipCarousel to true by default - to be checked against mobile
Update ajxp_ role / plugin / repository editors.
Fix ajxp_conf layout resizing always showing some blank at the bottom, resize just after insertion.
Make sure share action does not appear in a menu
Fix minisite layouts initial loading
Create a static function to get ShareCenter instance (enabling the docblocks). Use it where possible. Start a readonly mode for ShareCenter.js
Display workspace alias, we could probably remove the unique ID
Test setting a user inside an AJXP_Node - could be used to impersonate a user instead of using logUser()
Carry on moving every actions / data concerning the shares inside the ShareCenter, out of ajxp_conf and presumabyl out of ajxp_user
Fix share actions
Clean ShareCenter
Fix passing 0 as related_object_id value to simpleStore
ShareCenter i18n / hide upload box for files.
Wrong call to list reload, triggers too much repainting
Update tags by directly setting them inside the shareData if possible, in the metadata otherwise.
Do not "enlargeToOwn" the events - check that it has no side effect
Fix share watch
Fix #538 Missing node.read in access.fs when reading unique nodes
Set up a datamodel-specific ActionsToolbar via XML. No more reference to sharing in ajxp_conf. Use datamodel-specific listings in My Shares dashboard tab and load from ShareCenter.
Last compile
Replace /node+ by /dir+ in the rest params, very strange it was probably broken.
Fix error in array_merge messing up with numeric keys.
First implementation of Auth Front End, simple impl of a keystore-based auth for the REST api.
Move get_xml_registry (and alias "state" action) in core.conf instead of gui.ajax, should not be there.
Implement RestAPI token-based authentication. Last todo is to check the nonce is never reused. Add ORDER parameter in auth frontends plugins to make sure they are called in the correct order. Introduce a specific /pydio/ path to query API for non-workspaces actions. To be documented and checked when generating workspace slugs.
ApikeyPane
Rework startup. Set Encoding and server URI via installer. Activate syncable features, rest API and backbone router by default.
Try to load dynamic file encoding.php
Create SessionLogin authentication frontend and replace core.auth actions. To be checked in all auth.* plugins Add a "PROTOCOL_TYPE" parameter to the auth frontends, to auto activate frontend for session-based or rest-based access points.
Fix startup installer
Remove share on node deletion.
Fix shared repositories listing problems
Re-adapt ftp special login screen in Auth.ftp driver
Forgot captcha Fix \ in new install web uri detection Adapt auth.multi (override login action)
MQObserver switching channels: always avoid using sendSync!
Oups unreferenced configs variable
Make sure to make the repository slugs unique - should be part of a futur upgrade script Hack shareCenter to display all actions in admin driver Sort plugins by name in actions lists
Removed all calls to ConfService::getRepository() in meta-like plugins (meta, metastore, index), as we have the RESTfull info from the passed accessDriver. Should be expanded to editors as well.
Fix Session Credentials & WebDAV Basic Auth
Print exception message when there is a stream_open error.
Meta.mount : check command result instead of re-running a second mount cmd.
beforeInitMeta has a new signature
Log invalid login attempts.
[SQL] Remove ajxp_simple_store create from mq.sql
Also log invalid login attemps via WebDAV.
Finished Italian translation for plugin 'core.ajaxplorer' and added the new one for 'access.fs'
FIX previous commit.
Added Italian translation for 'access.ajxp_conf' plugin
Make sure URI is totally URLEncoded by calling urldecode / rawurlencode to compute the correct hash. Fix pydio/pydio-sync/#26
Italian translation
Hook node indexation to changes tracking. We should probably have a parent indexation core plugin, extended by lucene, change tracker, and elasticsearch. Make sure to exclude recycle_bin from indexation for synchro
Remove dependency of authfront.session_login to gui.ajax - we use protocol detection anyway.
Add an optional stream=true parameter to the changes request. Json data is return one per line, the result is not real json but it can be that way easily "streamed" by consuming clients.
Filehasher: publish rsync extension support through a plugin exposed parameter - document sdk methods for rest access.
Fix event sent when appending data to an existing file (must be an update instead of a create)
Transform auth.cas into an authfront plugin. Expand CAS feature
Publish repository-scope parameters in the writeRepositoriesData() function - Add such a parameter in the meta.syncable plugin, to disallow sync on given workspaces
Silently delete failing alert to avoid filling error logs
Prevent null pointer
Do not cache query result
Fix repository-exposed caching
Flatten repository-scope props differently, makes it easier to search
Fix CAS authfront plugin
Fix icon problem
Allow WS creation on read-only FS if option CREATE is not set.
Carry on fixing bottlenecks when tons of users and repositories. Avoid loading repository list if not necessary. Make sure to apply limit when loading users through autocompleter. Fix regexp (must start with ^)
Fix WebDAV enabler & password form (close #556)
Fix canSwitchTo() method - make sure to include shared workspaces
Chase Pydio in users strings - Replace by APPLICATION_TITLE, except for About ...
Sharing : move link at the top of the dialog, add all necessary paramaters. Detect legacy publiclink or not to avoid blinking
When using download_form, passing query parameters through the action attribute does not work in IE or FF.
Fix password-protected minisite behaviours
Fix minisite_session parameter management
Refix share pane size
Make sure the router always keep the / when navigating to root, otherwise requests are sent to the upper folder.
Add json possible value to the format parameter for get_my_feed request
Make sure to updateAdminRights for admin user first creation We do have to load all repositories once for editing a role
Update share panel layout, set link at the top
Fix radio button problem in Role Editor
Minisite.php layout was missing the animate-css library
Fix PLUpload chunk size

Contributors: cdujeu, echampet, chusopr, joubertredrat, BlackLionPT, warhawk3407, andypmuc, Afterster, Ellega, TheLexus, terminal-addict, cfoellman, millsdude, bitstrings, thomasfrivold
Main new features

Tab-based editors: open editors in tabbed navigation, to work on many files at once.
New user Dashboard: displaying all personal parameters and custom data.
Faceted search: search files and folders by date, extension, date range, metadata, etc.
Sharing & emails
Update ShareCenter to create multiple links on a given file and associate an arbitrary tag data.
Add QRCode on shared links
Add an HTML layout for the emails, and pass a "main link" either by argument or from the main node of the notification
Ability to create personal contacts lists ("teams")
Add ENABLE_FOLDER_SHARING option in action.share, defaulting to true
Optional limit for number of shared users creation
Expand the Shared User creation form to fill user email, full name, send an email, etc.
Add a parameter to force old-school external email
Add a parameter to allow new users creation while sharing (true by default). Use AutoCompleter for AjxpMailer Send users_only in list_authorized_users to avoid retrieving groups.
GUI Performances
Quicker start Customize dialogbox with a className.
Use CSS animation when possible to make it lighter
Fix ResourcesManager : was loading css multiple times
Performance Hunting: divided by 3,5 the display of long list of files. Todo: monitor for side-effects
Minisite: remove the inlineToolbar, it creates big performances problems, we have to find an alternative for that in the mobile GUI as well.
Plugins
Comments feed
Rework metadata modifiers and Meta.user plugin. Implement a custom SelectBox choice. Should replace and close #255.
Selection cart and save search advanced.
Add avatar plugins (Gravatar and Libravatar)
Relayout admin dashboard
Simple implementation of WebODF viewer. Only as viewer for the moment, we have to get a way to send back the modif in a standard manner, probably by replacing the Runtime implementation.
Add plugin auth.radius
Add YOURLS shortener, with optional IDN support
Rework AJXP_Logger - expose all log levels - accept a variable number of argument
Add PostgreSQL database support
Improvements and API Changes

Make sure to show controls on video when opened in editor.
Shared users: inherit parent personalRole if the parameter is marked as inherit.
Allow administrators to disable WebDAV on individual repositories. This is necessary for repositories that depend on session credentials because clients such as Windows default WebDAV do not use sessions.
Implement WebDAV Basic authentication the same way as Digest.
FS: Pass __AJXP_ZIP_FLAT__ to makeZip function to force all files to be at level 0 Fix tabulator et splitter resizing issues Download Cart.
Use FeedStore instead of MetaStore to have recursive meta. Could be expanded to a more generic SQL-based metastore.
Impl #259 : if windows OS , alternative unoconv call.
Add office templates to Imagick support.
Rework "regexp" in listUsersPaginated / getUsersCount in class.sqlAuthDriver.php Now "^a" matches everything that start with a "a$" matches everything that end with a "^a$" matches exactly a (wasn't working) "a" matches everything that contains a (was matching exactly a)
Use HTML base tag instead of the previous complicated "travel_path_to_root" mechanism...
New access point for managing users self-service operations (currently reset password)
Make custom sort function to make sure users are sorted (fix #279)
New variable AJXP_SANITIZE_FILENAME, to be less restrictive on the allowed characters than AJXP_SANITIZE_HTML_STRICT. Particularly, allow commas in filename.
Login: trim username and password to avoid trailing and ending white space problems
Better API for get_my_feed. Ability to force recycle_bin creation in workspace share
Add node.share.create hooks
Add user.before_disconnect and user.after_disconnect hooks
Optionally attach a link to LogoWidget or RepositorySimpleLabel via ajxpOptions.
Fix minisite: > Display workspace description > Do not display label/description if no user logged.
API CHANGE: switch to nodes[] query parameters instead of file_0, file_1, file_2, etc. Unique "file" is still allowed though. Fix dblclick on IE10 and IE11, tested on WIN7 and 8
Add a stat_hash action to extend standard stat with the file hash.
Repository switch and loading optimization: avoid loading all available repository when we already know the repository ID. Should have a great impact on REST-based access, typically WebDAV.
New meta.syncable plugin keep tracks of all changes with a global revision number (inspired by couchdb mechanism)
Meta.filehasher: Add an optional caching mechanism to the full XML tree
Change how uploader.html depends on uploader.flex, should impact plugins ordering, but not activation.
Move copy operations into AbstractAccessDriver to factorize normal and cross-repository copies. Enable cross-repository copy for folders. To be tested extensively.
Strengthen again the security level of zoho plugin. Could be circumvented if people did not change their secret key.
Add two new parameters to the ls action, only playing for recursive case: max_depth and max_nodes. If activated ( = recursion is cut before the end), the folder nodes have a new property ajxp_has_children = true|false to decide whether client must recurse again or not.
Add an optional parameter for ZIP filenames encoding at creation. CP437 is a working value for Windows, but then archive is incorrect on mac... The best we can do to fix #10
LDAP: use ldap_sort instead of a custom sorter Fix filter differing in count and list users Fix groups listing - user object update when filter is empty
Add a parameter in LDAP to search users by another attribute
Check regexp on userId or userLabel ConfCenter: New parameter: get users from all groups (search them), and display whole list. ShareCenter: Sticking to userExists("write") is creating a local user instead of getting it from master auth.
Revert previous commit disabling users creation: add a parameter instead CACHE_MASTER_USERS_TO_SLAVE, set to true by default for backward compat.
In DEBUG mode, display stack trace in errors

-----
Pydio 5.1.1

This release is a bugfix of 5.1.0, and a release candidate for 5.2.0.

There is not yet an upgrade mechanism, thus it is not tagged stable: it is not meant to be deployed in production, unless you know what you are doing.

We need you to test and report bugs ASAP to make sure we achieve stability soon! Update from 5.1.0 can be done using the in-app upgrade mechanism by switching the updater to the "development" channel. Please read 5.1.0 release note to discover the new features.

[core.auth] Generally, avoid recomputing merged role after calling addRole() if there is no real changes.
[core.conf] When updating the INSTANCE of core.auth or core.conf, force disconnexion and remove admin_counted file to make sure it the user is not logged out.

Readapt the core.auth plugin to automatically convert parameters into auth.multi driver
Refactoring : Move QUEUES stuff from core.notification to core.mq

Send template only if the header is text/html, to avoid resending the whole thing if a wrong request is sent.
AJXP_PLUGIN : Load Options Default like for global parameters …
Move initActivePlugins from ConfService to AJXP_PluginsService
Move all bootstrap_plugins configs to a specific boot.conf AbstractConfDriver implementation
Use AJXP_Utils::cleanDibiDriverParameters() when using a dibi like field

> Move AJXP_Logger class to core.log, instanciate the real logger using the core plugin config.
> Plugins list : skip core plugin that don't have any parameters to avoid polluting display

Mailer is now part of the core (using phpmail-lite)
User feed : store events and alerts as a feed : this requires SQL and is not enabled by default for the moment.
Pass host & port to ws-server.php

Reuse opened WsSocketClient to send multiple messages during request lifecycle.
Auto switch between websocket and polling
Use hook for mailer instead of dispatching directly

[action.share] Try displaying USER_DISPLAY_NAME whenever possible
[action.share] Set the resolveAsParent flag on user before getting the PATH option, to make sure it's correctly resolved for computing
[action.share] Make sure to avoid // in public link

[index.lucene] Special * query to send whole arborescence (performances test)
New variable AJXP_GROUP_PATH_FLAT to avoid seeing subgroups folders
Save digest HA1 on password update (if TRANSMIT_CLEAR_PASS is set to true), to avoid having to re-enter a
password for WebDAV >> To validate
Utils : do not sanitize HTML for textarea fields / Pass these fields value as CDATA, not attribute.
Make sure to send node.change event AFTER download (otherwise it triggers an output_buffer).
Set doc/ppt/xls mimes in core, not only zoho
Apply ultreia suggestion to trim only null characters (ultreia)
Trigger upload directly when ios-client / apache

PERFORMANCES
Perf hunting : introduce an accessible cache for full registry queries
Perf hunting : fullMetaCache broken by alternating global and local cache. Always use ajxpNode->isLeaf()
instead of is_file / is_dir.
The getTrueSizeOnFileSystem is VERY time consuming, we could maybe use a cache. The long part is now located in renderAjxpNode() and xmlEntities() function...


------ 4.3.0 Release note

AUTH/CONF COMPONENTS MASSIVE REWRITE
. Groups implementation : users can now be part of “groups“, and a user can be administrator of a sub-group only. Repositories and roles can be marked with a given group as well, making them accessible only to the users of the group and below. This is a good step toward multi-tenancy. Groups are also accessible for sharing : ability to share with a whole group at once.
. Roles generalization : The role concept is now a generic container for a extended set of data : ACL, but also plugins Parameters and plugins actions set to be disabled. Roles can be manually created, but a user will by default inherit its rights from a default "personal" role, and from roles attached to its groups. This is making the configurations/ACL ultra-flexible, and you can for example set different configs parameters for two different groups, and then override these for a specific user if necessary.  These parameters and actions can also be applied to a chosen "scope" for repositories : All Repositories, Shared Repositories, or each repository one by one. See this page for more info : http://ajaxplorer.info/documentation/administration/4b-configs-roles-ajaxplorer-5/
. The old "CUSTOM_DATA" fields defined in the conf drivers options are now actually brought by plugins manifest, and a "scope" attribute allows to attach these custom fields to either the users, the groups, or the roles (or all of them).
. Roles (and by extension users and groups), Repositories and Plugins now have their own brand new editors.
. A “lock" property of the users can trigger a predefined action just after login, useful for either forcing pass change, or setting a GUC to validate. If set to "logout", the user just cannot log.

WEBDAV COMPONENT REPLACEMENT
The WebDAV component, previously powered by ezComponent, was entirely replaced by SabreDAV, which is by far a more active and stable project. As a result, webDAV should be working way better, litmus tests are passing 100%, even with MacOS Finder! As a bonus, we added the possibility to point to the parent url (/shares/) with a listing of all available repositories depending on the user logged. Finally, a WEBDAV_BROWSER_LISTING option allows you to access the very simple webdav list directly in the web browser.
WARNING : THIS NOW ADD A REQUIREMENT TO PHP5.3!

NEW PLUGINS
[access.hpcloud] First implementation of HPCloud Object Storage access, based on their PHP bindings + patch. See if possible to send back the changes.
[cypher.encfs] Experimental implementation of encfs : dynamically create / mount / umount an encfs filesystem. Nice trick to handle the creation via STDIN. Requires web-server user to have sudo access to encfs and encfsctl commands. Implementation is using specific folder prefixes and node filtering. New "force_copy_delete" parameter in fsAccessDriver when moving directories from/to a mounted folder. Automatically unmount all folders at logout/repo_switch, pass the XML template & password as plugin configurations. Remind to add www-data or equivalent to sudoers for encfs and encfsctl commands.
[metastore.xattr] XAttr metastore implementation, seems to be working quite well. Requires xattr, libattr (libattr1-dev on debian), and pecl xattr extension.
[meta.watch] Update Mailer, new meta "watch" for watching a folder and getting notification on it. How to watch a root folder? Share and Watch together
[core.mailer] Generic plugin for sending email. Unique implementation yet is using phpmailer-lite.
[core.notification] USE_QUEUE parameter in NotificationCenter / Base for notification templates via i18n library
[mailer.phpmailer-lite] Mailer implementation


PLUGINS FIXES
[meta.git] Fix performChecks function
[editor.diaporama] Compute image ratio using JS when not available via metadata.
[editor.diaporama] Optimize for remote wrappers by caching references to real file whenever possible.
[editor.diaporama] PThumb : deprecated join calls
Fix spaces (rmeske)
[Access.dropbox] better error handling (could trigger a memory fault)
[log.text] : send syslog error when recursive problem.
[access.fs] Catch opendir failed call error / Remove unused countFiles call for recycle bin.
[editor.soundmanager] : totally disable for IE < 9 .
[conf.serial] Fixes in conf.serial/AJXP_User and in ldapAuthDriver for case sensitivity problems.
[action.scheduler] Add a log in fakeLongTask
[auth.ldap] Do not initialize the LDAP Connection in init() function, otherwise it's triggered for no reason most of the time.
[action.share] Resolve AJXP_USER as parent only in a controlled environnement > Better logs for shared links actions (do not mix with author login anymore)
[meta.filehasher] Fix : filling /tmp/ dir with filehasher_patch files...
[conf.sql] New table ajxp_simple_store for multi-purpose storage. This is getting closer to JCR / PHPCR approach !!!
[meta.quota] Implement SoftQuota
[meta.filehasher] Meta.filehasher : remove rsync actions to "advertise" the fact that rsync is not on the server.


CORE FRAMEWORK (PluginService & Controller)
New variables filters AJXP_GROUP_PATH, AJXP_ALLOW_SUB_PATH
Ability to load manifests contribs including external files (for listing actions).
Add ajxp_folder mime_type to "ls" action, to allow the actions discrimination by mime types for folders as well. To be checked for side-effects!

This is a bug fix release, and introduce two new features : simple but efficient documents automatic-versionning based on GIT,
and Amazon S3 driver. Other clouds drivers will come soon (Swift from Open Stack among others).

[NEW FEATURES]
Meta.git    : Git based versioning, way more simple than with svn, simply install GIT on the server and install the PEAR/VersionControl_Git library. Open in browser, revert to a given revision, cosmetics.

[access.smb] Make sure to register smb:// wrapper (bug in cross-repository copy)
[access.smb] Apply Thomas Oettli tweaks (new DOMAIN parameter).
[access.ajxp_confDriver] Not very nice, but working, make sure to register meta.svn & meta.git after the others (will trigger the hooks accordingly) @todo : generic reflexion on the hooks/plugins ordering.
[action.scheduler] Missing xmlEntities call on repositories list, could break the interface.
[action.scheduler] Make sure the folder is also initialize on unserialization
[meta.quota] Fix shell epression used for computing quota on Darwin
[core.auth] Wrong ajax response on pass-change error, reported by @ultreia
[AJXP_Utils] Fix from @mattlef : avoid exception on empty extension filename

[CLI & ASSOCIATED TEST]
CLI : detect / configure / use COM WScript.Shell to enable command line on IIS. Require giving correct rights to the cmd.exe executable.
Typo error totally breaking the PHPCLI test.
Test CLI : more tests on safe_mode & exec detection to be sure it will not crash

[WebDAV]
Disable locking for the moment, triggering too much random upload problem
[Quotas] webDAV and quota checking
[WebDAV] Fix error if a repository has no metastore
Conf.sql :  getRepositoryByAlias was simply broken, making webDAV fail when using conf.sql

Replication         : Ability to replicate groups of fields in the standard form kit.
