<p>Real-time collaboration directly in Pydio! This plugin requires the etherpad-lite server to be running on your server, please read the <a href="http://etherpad.org">http://etherpad.org</a> website to see how to install. Then you'll just have to configure the plugin with the server URL (full url, like http://public_IP:9001) and the api key, generated in the APIKEY.txt file at the first launch of etherpad-lite.</p>
