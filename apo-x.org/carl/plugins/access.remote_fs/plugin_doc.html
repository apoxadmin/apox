<p>This plugin makes Pydio act as a simple proxy to himself, and can be in someway faster than the remote_ftp, if you want to manage various repositories located on various server that all have an web access. In a standard installation, Pydio is always composed of a client part (the AjaX interface) and a server part accessing the files (via the access.fs plugin generally). The idea here is to install the " server part " on the remote server, and " a proxy " and " client part " on the local server, the proxy being in fact a server configured with remote_fs. Except for installation and users management ease, you could in fact remove the whole " client " folder of the remote server Pydio installation. The server part can even be something totally different that is simply implementing Pydio API.</p>

<p>The " client " can authenticate to the " server " via two ways : either by transmitting an Pydio user, or by using http authentification. See the parameters description for more detail.</p>
