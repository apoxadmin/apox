            If you have permissions issues, you can use the "sudo" parameter to sudo all system operations.
            In that case, make sure to set the sudoers permission accordingly: apache user (www-data or httpd generaly) must be allowed to
            perform a mount operation using sudo.
        </p>
        <p>
            To strengthen the security, use the parameter to pass password via the system environment and not via the command line itself. Sudo file must also be adapted to be allowed for that ( something like defaults@pydio-*-app* env_keep += "PASSWD").
