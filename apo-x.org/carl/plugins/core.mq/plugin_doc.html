<p>Message Queuing is an instant-messaging system allowing the client applications (like the Web GUI) to be informed in real-time of the server changes: documents movements, new events/alerts published in feed, etc. Although quite powerfull, it relies on a standard setup on the regular polling of the server. Web Clients register to a given temporary channel, and check events from this channel on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>Thus, if this seems to downgrade the performance of your server, you may consider switching on the Web Socket server instead. With that technology, modern browsers will just connect once to the WebSocket and receive news from the server in real-time, without polling. You can start and monitor the WebSocket server from this Settings pane, make sure to have the Command Line active in the Pydio Main Options.</p>
