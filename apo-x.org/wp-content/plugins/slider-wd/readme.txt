Slider WD is an effective tool for adding responsive sliders to your website. The WordPress slider plugin can be added both as a widget and plugin, as well as be included in the theme for displaying the slider within the theme using PHP function. Slider WD allows adding both images and videos (currently supporting YouTube and Vimeo to be displayed as slider slides). The numerous transition effects and layer support enhance the functionality of the WordPress slider plugin.  

The number of the slides for each slider is not limited. Various layers can be applied for each individual slide. There are three basic types of layers designed for the slides. Those are for sharing textual content, images and sharing buttons (Google+, Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook.) The slides can be used for redirection to another location.  Similar feature is also available with the text and image layers of WordPress Slider plugin.

The plugin comes with  a few demo sliders on its demo page, which are representing the main types of sliders supported by the plugin, whereas you can always enhance the plugin functionality combining slider types. The mentioned four types are Multi-Layer Slider, 3D Full-Width Slider, Filmstrip Slider, Zoom Effect Slider. Let’s discuss each of the types separately.

Multi-layer slider is designed for displaying textual, image and social sharing layers over the slides. This type of sliders are most commonly used when you are trying to create a slider similar to one created with PowerPoint or other presentation and slider software.

3D Full-width Slider is designed for displaying full-size sliders on any of your website pages. It uses a special effect for shifting between slides creating a 3D effect. This  slider takes the width of the page, where it’s included.

Filmstrip slider is designed for displaying small icons of the set of slides included in the slider. This is especially useful, if you have large set of slides and do want the user to choose which slide of the slider start the showcase. In addition to this, you can use this type of slider as an alternative to gallery plugins, where the displayed image opens up in a larger lightbox, which is not as convenient.

Zoom Effect slider is convenient, where you have small space but want to represent the main image and enlarged extract of it. Here the image gets zoomed without switching between slides of the slider. Each image and its extract are being included in a single slide. Thus this slider is more effective when used with HD images.

If you don’t want to limit yourself with one of these types of sliders, then you can freely use a combination, e.g. have multi-layer slider with 3D effect or flimstrip slider with zoom effect.
