2. Activate the Plugin

If you get an error message saying that the upload directory is not writable create the directory `/wp-content/uploads/filebase` and make it writable (FTP command: `CHMOD 777 wp-content/uploads/filebase`) for the webserver.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can do I get the AJAX tree view like on http://fabi.me/downloads/ ? =

This feature is called File Browser. Go to WP-Filebase settings and click on the tab 'File Browser'. There you can select a post or page where the tree view shoud appear.

= How do I insert a file list into a post?  =

In the post editor click on the *WP-Filebase* button. In the appearing box click on *File list*, then select a category. Optionally you can select a custom template.

= How do I list a categories, sub categories and files?  =

To list all categories and files on your blog, create an empty page (e.g named *Downloads*). Then goto *WP-Filebase Settings* and select it in the post browser for the option *Post ID of the file browser*.
Now a file browser should be appended to the content of the page.

= How do I add files with FTP? =

Upload all files you want to add to the WP-Filebase upload directory (default is `wp-content/uploads/filebase`) with your FTP client. Then goto WP-Admin -> Tools -> WP-Filebase and click *Sync Filebase*. All your uploaded files are added to the database now. Categories are created automatically if files are in sub folders.

= How do I customize the appearance of filelists and attached files? =

You can change the HTML template under WP-Filebase -> Settings. To edit the stylesheet goto WP-Admin -> Tools -> WP-Filebase and click *Edit Stylesheet*.
Since Version 0.1.2.0 you can create your custom templates for individual file lists. You can manage the templates under WP-Admin -> Tools -> WP-Filebase -> Manage templates. When adding a tag to a post/page you can now select the template.

= How can I use custom file type/extension icons? =

WP-Filebase uses WordPress' default file type icons in `wp-includes/images/crystal` for files without a thumbnail. To use custom icons copy the icon files in PNG format named like `pdf.png` or `audio.png` to `wp-content/images/fileicons` (you have to create that folder first).

= What to do when downloading files does not work? =

Goto WP-Filebase Settings and disable Permalinks under "Download". Try to disable other plugins. Disable WP_CACHE. Enable WP_DEBUG to get more info about possible errors.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.2.0 =
PHP 5 or later required! This is a big upgrade with lots of new features. You have to convert old content tags to new shortcodes. Go to WP-Filebase management page and you should see a yellow box with the converter notice (backup the Database before!). And sync the filebase after that!

== Documentation ==
[WP-Filebase Documentation](https://wpfilebase.com/documentation/)

== Translation ==
If you want to translate WP-Filebase in your language, open `wp-filebase/languages/template.po` with [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/download.php) and save as `wpfb-xx_YY.po` (`xx` is your language code, `YY` your country). Poedit will create the file `wpfb-xx_YY.mo`. Put this file in `wp-filebase/languages` and share it if you like (attach it to an email or post it on my blog).

== Plugin Developers ==
WP-Filebase currently offers the action `wpfilebase_sync`. This will run a fast filebase sync that adds new files.

The hook `wpfilebase_file_downloaded` with file_id as parameter can be used for download logging.

== WP-Filebase Pro ==
[WP-Filebase Pro](https://wpfilebase.com/) is the commercial version of WP-Filebase with an extended range of functions. It supports secondary categories, extended permissions, embedded upload forms. Furthermore it can generate PDF thumbnails, sync with Dropbox or FTP and includes an improved file sync algorithm.

== Traffic Limiter ==
If you only want to limit traffic or bandwidth of media files you should take a look at my [Traffic Limiter Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/traffic-limiter/ "Traffic Limiter").
