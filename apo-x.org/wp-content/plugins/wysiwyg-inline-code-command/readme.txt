Adds a button and keybinding to the WYSIWYG (visual) editor to mark
text as inline code.

== Description ==

The WYSIWYG Inline Code Command plugin adds an "inline code" command to the
WYSIWYG (visual) post and page editor. It's just like the "Bold" or "Italics"
commands, except that it makes your text look like code -- usually, this means
that it's drawn in a monospace font `like this`. The comand is accessible as a
button and with the keybinding `Alt-Shift-C`.

The unmodified editor does provide a `pre` style that's somewhat similar, but
it's a *block* style, which means that you can only apply it to whole
paragraphs. I wrote this plugin because I found that I often want to apply
code styling to shorter pieces of computer-y content, such as the
`Alt-Shift-C` above.

I encourage you to provide feedback about this plugin. Entries on the
compatibility matrix are especially helpful so that people can feel confident
installing it. Thanks!

The WYSIWIG Inline Code Command plugin provides precisely this one feature, so
don't expect it to be updated very often. One issue that I'm aware but don't
know quite how to fix is that the user-visible text describing the command in
the editor isn't internationalized.

== Installation ==

Installation is as simple as possible:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `wysiwyg-inline-code-command` directory
   in your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Edit a post or a page. Select some text, and either hit the new button
   that looks like "</>", or press `Alt-Shift-C`.
1. That's all there is to it!

I haven't made any screenshots yet. Let me know if you'd like to see one.
